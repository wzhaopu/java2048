In Part 1, we write program to initiate an array from user's input and 
reverse an array of integers by using the same method again inside that
method so that the program will not stop until it reach the requirement. 
For testing, I use a testing file and try all kinds of possiblities of 
arrays to check the behavior of the program. I learn some new ways to deal
with arrays in this part.
In Part 2, we write program of the visual board of the game 2048. The 
program creates a game board for 2048 with 16 squares including numbers and
the tile and the score. To test it I simply runs it several times and
plays the game to test the behavior. I learn how to create a game that
is more clearly viewed by the player.

Short Response:
1) mkdir -p fooDir/barDir
2) I can use javac *.java while compiling my files. It will compile all
the java files in current directory.
3) gvim *.java
4) static means that the method doesn't need a calling object. An example
can be math methods such as Math.absolute()
5) She can add subclasses for different shape such as CircleDrawer,
SquareDrawer and then in these subclasses write draw methods with color as
parameter to draw different colors of one shape.
